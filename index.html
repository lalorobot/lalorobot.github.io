	<h2>About me</h2>
</div>
<p>I'm a senior aeronautical engineering student in Mexico, set to graduate April 2024. My main interests lay in turbomachinery, dynamics and CFD applied to power generation, propulsion and refrigeration. I'm proficient in ANSYS Fluent, Matlab, Fortran and Python applied to numerical problems and post processing of data; I'm currently improving my skills C++ and OpenFOAM and working in researching turbulence models in turbine cooling systems.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this page is to serve as a portfolio for my various projects as well as a progress blog for them and database for whatever problems and solutions I find.</p>
